This project presents the development of an inclusive E-learning platform designed to enhance accessibility, productivity, engagement, and user experience in online education. Built with a modern tech stack, the platformâ€™s frontend mainly utilizes React.js to deliver an intuitive, responsive user interface, while Django serves as the backend framework to manage robust and secure server-side operations. PostgreSQL is employed as the database management system, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of extensive user and content data. In addition to standard E-learning features such as course management, attendance logging, and progress tracking, this platform is specifically tailored to support users with disabilities who may face challenges in traditional educational settings. With accessibility-enhancing design elements, the platform aims to empower individuals who cannot attend inperson learning environments, providing a user-friendly and adaptable solution that meets diverse needs.
